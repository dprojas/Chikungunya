1.	Burt2012: Chikungunya: a re-emerging virus (Lancet 2012; 379: 662–71)
•	This paper focuses on the re- emergence of this disease since 2000, the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis of virus-induced arthralgia, diagnostic techniques, and various treatment modalities.
•	Incubation period ranges from 1 day to 12 days, with an average of 2–4 days. 
•	Asymptomatic infections are rare; roughly 3–25% of people with serological evidence of infection have no obvious symptoms.
•	Likelihood of developing persistent arthralgia was associated with age (>45y)
•	Neurological involvement was reported in about 25% of patients with atypical CHIKV infection (<0·1% of all patients admitted to hospital). These neurological manifestations are related with underlying comorbid conditions as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. 
•	Vertical transmission: Encephalophy in newborn.

•	General information about chikungunya. Information about recent outbreaks. 
•	Aedes albopictus: relatively long-lived (4–8weeks) and has a flight radius of 400–600 m.
•	In urban settings the disease is characterized by abrupt, massive epidemics with high attack rates (37-75%). 
•	74% of cases were over 30 years of age

6.	Pulmanausahakul2011. Chikungunya in Southeast Asia: understanding the emergence and finding solutions. International Journal of Infectious Diseases 15 (2011) e671–e676
•	Chikungunya transmission in SEA
•	Differences between the linages of CHIKV, affinity with the vectors in urban or rural settings. 
•	Vector control strategies: Primarily centered around vector control strategies that seek to reduce potential breeding sites, kill larvae through the action of larvicides such as temephos or Bacillus larvicidal toxins,  or reduce the numbers of adult mosquitoes through space spraying using pyrethroids or organophosphates. 
•	Public awareness programs aimed at reducing breeding sites for mosquitoes around the home. Vector surveillance to the early detection of cases of dengue coupled with emergency vector control programs at identified outbreak clusters. 

7.	Renault2007. A Major Epidemic of Chikungunya Virus Infection on Réunion Island, France, 2005–2006. (Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 2007;77:4, 727–731)
•	Overall attack rate of 35%
•	The less- affected age group was persons 0–9 years of age and incidence increased continuously up to 89 years of age. 
•	Mortality rate associated with chikungunya virus infection was 0.3/1,000 persons; median age at death was 79 years.
•	Factors may have contributed to the exceptionally dynamic characteristics of the epidemic: the immune status of the population relative to this emerging virus, housing density, vector density and other entomologic characteristics, knowledge of and behavior of the population towards individual protection, and control of larval habitats.

8.	Simon2008. Chikungunya: A Paradigm of Emergence and Globalization of Vector-Borne Diseases. Med Clin N Am 92 (2008) 1323–1343
•	Describe clinical manifestations in detail. 
•	88% of CHIKV-infected patients declared themselves cured 3 years after disease onset, whereas 12.1% mentioned persistent symptoms including occasional discomfort, persistent joint stiffness, or stiffness, pain and effusion
•	Pain or stiffness was more severe and more prolonged in the oldest patients and in those who had previous rheumatism. 
•	95% of CHIKV-infected adults are symptomatic, and most working adults become disabled, with loss of mobility, hand handicap, and depressive reaction, which can each last for weeks to months.
•	Underlying diseases and age are the most important negative prognostic factors associated with death. 
•	Three genotypes: Asian, East/Central/South African, and West African.
•	Viral mutations to adapt to the available vector. 

9.	Simon2011. Chikungunya Virus Infection. Curr Infect Dis Rep (2011) 13:218–228
•	India, the national burden of the CHIKV outbreak in 2006 was estimated to be 25,588 disability-adjusted life years, 69% of which were attributed to persistent arthralgia.
•	3 CHIKV profiles: 
1)African profile: (1950-2000) occasional small epidemics in rural areas similar to sylvatic yellow fever
2)Asian profile: (2000-2005) urban outbreaks involving rather anthropophilic mosquitoes, mainly Ae. aegypti as observed in dengue fever. The situation changed rapidly in Reunion Island, where the new A226V-CHIKV strain quickly became predominant and generated an explosive outbreak because of its adaptation to Ae. albopictus. 
3)Global profile: The A226V-CHIKV is highly efficient at spreading through human populations in tropical and temperate countries
•	Table presence-absence of Aedes vectors worldwide.

•	Manifestations and Associated Factors over a 15-Month Period..At the 15-month-period evaluation after diagnosis, 57% self-reported rheumatic symptoms. 63% reported permanent trouble, 37% had recurrent symptoms.

12.	Thiboutot2010. Chikungunya: A Potentially Emerging Epidemic?
•	Ae. albopictus is common in urban areas of the United States and is already flourishing in 36 states, raising grave concerns to the immunologically naive populace of the United States.
•	E1-A226V mutation allowed CHIKV’s secondary vector species, Ae. albopictus, to supplement Ae. aegypti as its primary vector. Also enabled an increase in infectivity of Ae. albopictus when compared to its infectivity of Ae. aegypti.  
•	Ae. albopictus has become the new preferred vector for CHIKV. E1-A226V virus was 100 times more infective to Ae. albopictus than it was to Ae. aegypti
•	Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes captured in Florida were susceptible to CHIKV infection by a La Reunion isolate. 
•	50% of newborns delivered while the mother was infected with CHIKV contracted the disease from their mother, despite the method of delivery, causing congenital illness and fetal death
